# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by John Q. Student*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

**Link to a video of your virbation motor**

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard

**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?**

The yellow wire is  connected to signal on pin 9. Red connects to 5v power and brown connects to ground.

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino

**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?**

The servo should be attached to pin 9 for the signal.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?**

The variable pos stores the servo position and the position is changed in the loop() with for loops that change the position by 1 degree and a delay of 15 milliseconds between degrees.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**
